## 💬 Who Am I?

I'm a passionate full stack developer based in Bangalore who loves building meaningful digital experiences — from scalable backend APIs to clean and responsive frontends.

After starting my career in QA automation, I shifted my focus to full-stack development because I enjoy being involved in both the **how** and the **why** behind a product.

Whether it's integrating YouTube APIs, implementing real-time notifications, or designing clean React components — I love crafting things that solve real-world problems.

💬 I'm also actively involved in **client meetings** to **demo, explain, and promote our product offerings**, which has helped me improve both my technical communication and business understanding.
